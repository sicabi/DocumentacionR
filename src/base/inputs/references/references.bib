	abstract = {Narrow bit-width data formats are key to reducing the computational and storage costs of modern deep learning applications. This paper evaluates Microscaling ({MX}) data formats that combine a per-block scaling factor with narrow floating-point and integer types for individual elements. {MX} formats balance the competing needs of hardware efficiency, model accuracy, and user friction. Empirical results on over two dozen benchmarks demonstrate practicality of {MX} data formats as a drop-in replacement for baseline {FP}32 for {AI} inference and training with low user friction. We also show the first instance of training generative language models at sub-8-bit weights, activations, and gradients with minimal accuracy loss and no modifications to the training recipe.},

Brent and Zimmermann present algorithms that are ready to implement in your favourite language, while keeping a high-level description and avoiding too low-level or machine-dependent details. The book is intended for anyone interested in the design and implementation of efficient high-precision algorithms for computer arithmetic, and more generally efficient multiple-precision numerical algorithms. It may also be used in a graduate course in mathematics or computer science, for which exercises are included. These vary considerably in difficulty, from easy to small research projects, and expand on topics discussed in the text.  Solutions to selected exercises are available from the authors.},
